<p>Hi there! I created this blog to document my journey switching careers into software/web development. 
    It was also a great opportunity to practically apply what I've learned so far.</p>
<p>Posts will centre around what I've learned along the way, mostly programming knowledge with some personal growth lessons sprinkled in. </p>
<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
