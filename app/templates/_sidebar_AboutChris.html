<p>Hi there! I created this blog to document my journey of switching career into software/web development. 
    It was also a great opportunity for a practical application of what I've learned so far.</p>
<p>Posts will centre around what I learned along the way, mostly programming knowledge with personal growth sprinkled in. </p>
<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
